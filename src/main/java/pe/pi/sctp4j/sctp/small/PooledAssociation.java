     10.2.  Probing Method Using SCTP

     In the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC2960], the
     application writes messages to SCTP, which divides the data into
     smaller "chunks" suitable for transmission through the network.  Each
     chunk is assigned a Transmission Sequence Number (TSN).  Once a TSN
     has been transmitted, SCTP cannot change the chunk size.  SCTP multi-
     path support normally requires SCTP to choose a chunk size such that
     its messages to fit the smallest PMTU of all paths.  Although not
     required, implementations may bundle multiple data chunks together to
     make larger IP packets to send on paths with a larger PMTU.  Note
     that SCTP must independently probe the PMTU on each path to the peer.

     The RECOMMENDED method for generating probes is to add a chunk
     consisting only of padding to an SCTP message.  The PAD chunk defined
     in [RFC4820] SHOULD be attached to a minimum length HEARTBEAT (HB)
     chunk to build a probe packet.  This method is fully compatible with
     all current SCTP implementations.

     SCTP MAY also probe with a method similar to TCP's described above,
     using inline data.  Using such a method has the advantage that
     successful probes have no additional overhead; however, failed probes
     will require retransmission of data, which may impact flow
     performance.

     6.2.1.  Processing a Received SACK

     Each SACK an endpoint receives contains an a_rwnd value.  This value

     One of the problems the data sender must take into account when

             was greater than or equal to cwnd), increase cwnd by MTU, and

     the received SACK does not advance the Cumulative TSN Ack Point, the
     endpoint MUST NOT adjust the cwnd of any of the destination
     addresses.

     Because an endpoint's cwnd is not tied to its Cumulative TSN Ack
     Point, as duplicate SACKs come in, even though they may not advance
     the Cumulative TSN Ack Point an endpoint can still use them to clock
     out new data.  That is, the data newly acknowledged by the SACK
     diminishes the amount of data now in flight to less than cwnd, and so
     the current, unchanged value of cwnd now allows new data to be sent.
     On the other hand, the increase of cwnd must be tied to the
     Cumulative TSN Ack Point advancement as specified above.  Otherwise,
     the duplicate SACKs will not only clock out new data, but also will
     adversely clock out more new data than what has just left the
     network, during a time of possible congestion.

     o  When the endpoint does not transmit data on a given transport
     address, the cwnd of the transport address should be adjusted to
     max(cwnd/2, 4*MTU) per RTO.

         C4)  When data is in flight and when allowed by rule C5 below, a new
         RTT measurement MUST be made each round trip.  Furthermore, new
         RTT measurements SHOULD be made no more than once per round trip
         for a given destination transport address.  There are two
         reasons for this recommendation: First, it appears that
         measuring more frequently often does not in practice yield any
         significant benefit [ALLMAN99]; second, if measurements are made
         more often, then the values of RTO.Alpha and RTO.Beta in rule C3
         above should be adjusted so that SRTT and RTTVAR still adjust to
         changes at roughly the same rate (in terms of how many round
         trips it takes them to reflect new values) as they would if
         making only one measurement per round-trip and using RTO.Alpha
         and RTO.Beta as given in rule C3.  However, the exact nature of
         these adjustments remains a research issue.

         C5)  Karn's algorithm: RTT measurements MUST NOT be made using
         packets that were retransmitted (and thus for which it is
         ambiguous whether the reply was for the first instance of the
         chunk or for a later instance)

         IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: RTT measurements should only be made using
         a chunk with TSN r if no chunk with TSN less than or equal to r
         is retransmitted since r is first sent.

         C6)  Whenever RTO is computed, if it is less than RTO.Min seconds
         then it is rounded up to RTO.Min seconds.  The reason for this
         rule is that RTOs that do not have a high minimum value are
         susceptible to unnecessary timeouts [ALLMAN99].

         C7)  A maximum value may be placed on RTO provided it is at least
         RTO.max seconds.
